## G-DASH: Gulden Witness & Node Dashboard

G-DASH is a lightweight, responsive, web-based user interface for Gulden 
users who run a wallet, node, witnessing account, or all of the above on 
a unix server (i.e. a Raspberry Pi). Using this dashboard users can keep 
an eye on their Gulden server and control their nodes and witnessing 
account without the need of a terminal. It also includes the option to 
control a Gulden wallet, and the software has auto-update functionality 
to make sure you always run the latest version of G-DASH. 

This dashboard is created with the idea to keep everything as simple as 
possible, so even people who are not very good with computers or don't 
understand how to set up a witness account can use this functionality 
of Gulden. Of course, new ideas and comments are always welcome. You 
can find me on the Gulden slack (@bastijn) at 
[guldencom.slack.com](https://guldencom.slack.com). I'm 
happy to talk to you, to answer any questions and to listen to any 
feedback.
